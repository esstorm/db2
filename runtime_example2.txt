The tables below are created only in ARAMIS database

Data about telephone calls
--------------------------
The views are created in schema NIKOVITS, you don't have to create them.

create view tel_center_v(district, c_id, c_name) as select * from kozpont;                        ~ 1250 rows
create view primer_v(district, city, provider, county) as select * from primer;                   ~ 70 rows
create view calls_v(calling_id, receiving_id, service, call_date, call_hour, no_calls, seconds)   ~ 45M rows
 as select * from hivas;
create view calls_v2(calling_id, receiving_id, service, call_date, call_hour, no_calls, seconds)  ~ 45M rows
 as select * from hivas_v2;

Some queries and their runtime. Let's see the execution plans, especially the costs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CALLS_V    partitioned table
CALLS_V2   not partitioned, but will be indexed

--230 sec  I created an index for the table.
create index hivas_datum_idx on hivas_v2(datum);

-- 4 sec  Full Table scan
select sum(seconds) from calls_v;

-- 4 sec  No advantage from partitioning, because we read all rows from the table.
select sum(seconds) from calls_v2;


-- 0.5 sec  We read only 1 partition, it is much faster
select sum(seconds) from calls_v where call_date = to_date('2012.01.31', 'yyyy.mm.dd');

-- 10 sec  We read all the partitions, because of the '+1'
select sum(seconds) from calls_v where call_date + 1 = to_date('2012.01.31', 'yyyy.mm.dd') + 1;

-- 0.1 sec  Index scan
select sum(seconds) from calls_v2 where call_date = to_date('2012.01.31', 'yyyy.mm.dd');

-- 2 sec  Index scan, a lot of rows
select sum(seconds) from calls_v2 where call_date between 
       to_date('2012.01.31', 'yyyy.mm.dd') and to_date('2012.02.20', 'yyyy.mm.dd');

-- 0,03 sec  Index reading only without reading the table, very fast
select count(*) from calls_v2 where call_date = to_date('2012.01.31', 'yyyy.mm.dd');

-- 3 sec  INDEX FAST FULL SCAN
select count(*) from calls_v2;

-- 2 sec  Hint improves performance !!! Optimizer fails to find the best plan.
select /*+ no_index(calls_v2) */ count(*) from calls_v2;


You can better evaluate and compare the efficiency of the queries if you run them several times
and compute the average run time.

DECLARE
  v_result NUMBER;
BEGIN
  FOR i IN 1 .. 10 LOOP
    SELECT /*+ no_index(calls_v2) */ count(*) INTO v_result from calls_v2;
  END LOOP;
END;
