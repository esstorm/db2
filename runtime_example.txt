Information about telephone centers, districts and telephone calls in Hungary
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the queries below we will use the following tables. 
(Actually they are views, based on hungarian table names, but this is not important now.)

PRIMER_V     (district, city, provider, county)                                            ~ 70 rows
TEL_CENTER_V (district, c_id, c_name)                                                      ~ 1250 rows
CALLS_V      (calling_id, receiving_id, service, call_date, call_hour, no_calls, seconds)  ~ 45M rows

Explanation
-----------
The area of Hungary is divided into disjunct districts - so called primer districts. 
Each district has a unique number from 0 to 99. When you call a telephone number +36-dd-nnnnnnn 
'dd' is the district number, 36 is the country code for Hungary. 
Each district has a central city, a service provider and a county.
Within each district, there are a lot of telephone centers. Telephone centers have a unique ID 
and a NAME. Subscriber lines are connected to telephone centers.
We store the following aggregated information about telephone calls:
calling_id:   the identifier of the calling telephone center 
receiving_id: the identifier of the receiving telephone center 
service:      service type of the calls 
call_date:    date of the call 
call_hour:    in which hour the telephone calls started
no_calls:     the total number of telephone calls in this 1 hour between the calling and receiving centers
seconds:      the total cumulated seconds of the calls in this hour between the given telephone centers.

The views below are created in schema NIKOVITS, you don't have to create them.

create view TEL_CENTER_V(district, c_id, c_name) as select * from kozpont;
create view PRIMER_V(district, city, provider, county) as select * from primer;
create view CALLS_V(calling_id, receiving_id, service, call_date, call_hour, no_calls, seconds)
 as select * from hivas;
create view CALLS_V2(calling_id, receiving_id, service, call_date, call_hour, no_calls, seconds)
 as select * from hivas_v2;


QUERY
-----
Take the first Monday of 2012. February, and give the summarized number of calls
on the previous day from the primer district whose city is Szentendre.


ALTER SESSION SET nls_date_language = american;  -- 'monday'

-- run-time: 10 sec 
SELECT sum(no_calls) FROM nikovits.calls_v ca, nikovits.tel_center_v ce, nikovits.primer_v p
WHERE ca.calling_id = ce.c_id AND ce.district = p. district AND p.city = 'Szentendre' 
AND ca.call_date + 1 = next_day(to_date('2012.01.31', 'yyyy.mm.dd'), 'monday');

-- run-time: 1 sec 
SELECT sum(no_calls) FROM nikovits.calls_v ca, nikovits.tel_center_v ce, nikovits.primer_v p
WHERE ca.calling_id = ce.c_id AND ce.district = p. district AND p.city = 'Szentendre' 
AND ca.call_date = next_day(to_date('2012.01.31', 'yyyy.mm.dd'), 'monday') - 1;


There are two similar queries above. What can cause the difference in run-time?
*******************************************************************************


The original tables have Hungarian names: KOZPONT, PRIMER, HIVAS

ALTER SESSION SET nls_date_language = hungarian;  -- 'monday'
-- 10 sec 
SELECT sum(darab) FROM nikovits.hivas, nikovits.kozpont, nikovits.primer
WHERE hivas.kozp_azon_hivo=kozpont.kozp_azon AND kozpont.primer=primer.korzet
AND primer.varos = 'Szentendre' 
AND datum + 1 = next_day(to_date('2012.01.31', 'yyyy.mm.dd'), 'hétfõ');


-- 1 sec 
SELECT sum(darab) FROM nikovits.hivas, nikovits.kozpont, nikovits.primer
WHERE hivas.kozp_azon_hivo=kozpont.kozp_azon AND kozpont.primer=primer.korzet
AND primer.varos = 'Szentendre' 
AND datum = next_day(to_date('2012.01.31', 'yyyy.mm.dd'), 'hétfõ') - 1;
